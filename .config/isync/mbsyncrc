## overall design
##

## Each of these configurations assume that I don't use the
## web interfaces (usually) for any of my servers and that I only
## use mu4e as my email client (because I am smarter than my
## smartphone).

## Further assumptions include that that the only "folders" (or labels)
## that I care about are inbox, archive, trash, and drafts (maybe).
## Anything beyond this turns email into something it is not (a
## terrible todo list). Spam/junk are useless to sync to a client
## machine (unless something important "goes to junk" which in my
## experience is extremely rare).

## To elaborate on the folders I do care about:
## - Inbox is the main interaction point with the email server/client.
## Mail comes in and I make the decision to reply (keep thread open in
## inbox), archive (important enough to keep, but not enough to stay
## in sight), or delete (just plain useless). (Note there is instant
## delete or move to trash depending on how sure I am of the message's
## uselessness). Note that ideally the inbox is empty...as in no
## files (regardless of read/unread). This keeps it fast and
## uncluttered.
## - Archive (or whatever this is called in the server) is for old
## messages that may be useful for reference). This is where many
## messages end up and accounts for most of the size/bulk of the files.
## This is also why small inbox is important, because searching through
## all these files is sloowwww.
## - Sent is useless (just search for To:notme in archive) so don't
## bother syncing at all.
## - Trash is useful but only locally. I found it was a pain to get
## trash to sync correctly with everything else mu4e does, so I don't
## actually sync this folder. Instead, server trash is for spam/auto-
## deleted crap found by my filters. Client trash works like actual
## trash on the web interface. If I lose my laptop...oh well, it's
## just trash :)
## - Drafts works just like trash in that it only is useful locally
## and not synced with the server. Ideally it is empty (why keep empty
## drafts??).

## gmail server
##

## To the best of my knowledge, gmail uses one giant folder and
## a bunch of "labels" to group emails. This is frustrating because
## it does not map to on-disk filesystem paths very nicely by default.
## Specifically, "All Mail" refers to everything minus trash/spam,
## and an "Inbox" label (folder?) is applied on top of this to denote
## the inbox messages. This leads to duplicates in many vanilla IMAP
## syncing solutions. (No idea why gmail was designed this way).

## To get around this, I created a new label called "rxv" (archive,
## because apparently this name is "system reserved" in gmail) to
## denote the "non-inbox" messages. This works but assumes that these
## labels are mutually exclusive (which has no enforcement in gmail)
## so all handling is done by mu4e to ensure that these are updated
## properly (eg msgs from inbox moved to archive folder). I also
## set auto-expunge = off and set deleted/expunged messages to be
## moved to trash (it could also be set to "delete forever" but trash
## is safer).

## NOTE: this does not seem to work all that well when one move from
## archive back to inbox (eg it actually double-labels the message)
## Since I hardly ever do this...whatever
