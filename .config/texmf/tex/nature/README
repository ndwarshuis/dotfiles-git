Nature package

Version: 1.0, 24 Feb. 2004

--------------------

This package is meant to aid people preparing scientific papers
in the journal Nature (Nature Publishing Group) using LaTeX.
Nature does not officially accept preprints or final drafts in
LaTeX.  However, they DO accept papers in PDF format, which is
of course not difficult to arrange.

The file nature.cls is the LaTeX2e class file that should be
used to write the document.  It is designed so that papers written
under a different class can be easily converted to Nature's style.
I attempted to conform to NPG's style as set out in their Microsoft
Word template file available from their website, including paragraph
spacing, indentation, etc.

The file naturemag.bst is the appropriate BibTeX style file to conform
to NPG's reference style, generated using the custom-bib package.  It
should be up-to-date as of this writing.

For more information, see the beginning of the class file.  The file
nature-template.tex gives an example/template of how to use the class
and gives some limited tips on NPG's requirements for submission.

I am in no way affiliated with NPG and make no claim that the style of
any document prepared using this package will conform to NPG's preprint
style exactly.  When in doubt, refer to their website at:

Good luck!
